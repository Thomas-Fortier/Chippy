# Chippy
A simple Chip8 emulator written in C#

## How to run
***Note: A descktop wrapper / ROM manager for the emulator is currently in development. This will change.***

The emulator's executable requrires a file path for the ROM to be specified: ``` Chippy.exe "{PATH_TO_ROM}" ```

## Remarks
The test ROMs that are used in this repository are from the [chip8-test-suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite).
